# Free throw game done in unity
This game consists of two different modes, survival and time attack


### Survival
The aim of the game here is to score as many shots without missing a single one. As you progress with the score, the game gets significantly harder


### Time Attack
In this game mode, your goal is to get as many balls in the hoop before the time runs out (30 seconds). If you do score, a second and a half gets added to the timer to compensate for the time you took shooting.


### High Scores
As of yet, the game does not save scores past the current session and global scores are not implemented.
